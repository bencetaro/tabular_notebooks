Here are my works on tabular datasets to demonstrate my data analysis skills. The uploaded notebooks in short description:

1. house_price_regression_spline_gam:
- This presents a solution to a regression problem for predicting the price of houses for sale.

2. forest-cover-type-classification-notebook:
- In this work, the goal was to predict the type of forest cover based on geographical factors (e.g. wilderness areas and soil type).

3. forest-cover-type-ensemble:
- Same dataset as 2. with more detailed EDA and model ensembling of Random Forest, Extratrees, XGBoost, CatBoost.

5. spaceship-titanic-notebook:
- In this Kaggle competition set in a sci-fi setting, the goal was to predict the chances of survival of the spaceship passengers.

5. car-insurance:
